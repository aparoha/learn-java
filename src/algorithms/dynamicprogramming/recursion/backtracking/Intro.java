/*
    Backtracking

    1. It is a form of recursion
    2. General algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems
    3. Also called constraint satisfaction problems
    4. Also important when solving combinatorial optimization problems i.e. travelling salesman problem
    5. It is often mush faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates - because it can eliminate a large
       number of candidates with single test
    6. We can represent most of these problems with a tree structure - game tree or potential search tree
